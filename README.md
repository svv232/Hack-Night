##Questions Manticore Can Be Applied Towards

> At point X in execution, is it possible for variable Y to be a specified value?
> Can the program reach this code at runtime?
> What is a program input that will cause execution of this code?
> Is user input ever used as a parameter to this libc function?
> How many times does the program execute this function?
> How many instructions does the program execute if given this input?
