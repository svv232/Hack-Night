<h2>Questions Manticore Can Be Applied Towards</h2> <br />

> At point X in execution, is it possible for variable Y to be a specified value?<br />
> Can the program reach this code at runtime?<br />
> What is a program input that will cause execution of this code?<br />
> Is user input ever used as a parameter to this libc function?<br />
> How many times does the program execute this function?<br />
> How many instructions does the program execute if given this input?<br />
